                On the first day of Christmas
                My true love gave to me:
                A partridge in a pear tree.

                On the second day of Christmas
                My true love gave to me:
                Two turtle doves and
                A partridge in a pear tree.

                On the third day of Christmas
                My true love gave to me:
                Three french hens
                Two turtle doves and
                A partridge in a pear tree.

                On the forth day of Christmas
                My true love gave to me:
                Four calling birds
                Three french hens
                Two turtle doves and
                A partridge in a pear tree.

                On the fifth day of Christmas
                My true love gave to me:
                Five golden rings
                Four calling birds
                Three french hens
                Two turtle doves and
                A partridge in a pear tree.

                On the sixth day of Christmas,
                My true love gave to me:
                Six geese a-laying
                Five golden rings
                Four calling birds
                Three french hens
                Two turtle doves and
                A partridge in a pear tree.

                On the seventh day of Christmas,
                My true love gave to me:
                Seven swans a-swimming
                Six geese a-laying
                Five golden rings
                Four calling birds
                Three french hens
                Two turtle doves and
                A partridge in a pear tree.
